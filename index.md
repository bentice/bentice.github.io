# Projects

## [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/u/bentice)

A few projects I've been working on using React.

* [Lord of the Rings Twitter](https://67gry.codesandbox.io/) a Lord of the Rings themed twitter app using Redux for state management.

* [Shelves](https://3soz4.codesandbox.io/) an app that displays books in different shelves and also searches for new books to add using the [Udacity Books Lender API](https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com/)

* [Star Wars Would You Rather](https://8jq54.csb.app/#/) a Star Wars Would You Rather Game using React, Redux, and Ant Design

## [Location, Location, Location...](http://rpubs.com/ben_tice/restzipcodes)

Mapping US restaurants and finding the most competitive ZIP codes for restaurants across the major metropolitan areas.

## [Enron Corpus: Network and Linguistic Analysis](Enron_Article.md)

Network Analysis and Linguistic Analysis of Enron Email Corpus for the purposes of replicating James Pennebaker's findings in ["Pronoun Use Reflects Standings in Social Hierarchies"](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.904.6689&rep=rep1&type=pdf). In a series of studies Pennebaker found that lower status individuals used more first-person singular pronouns (I) compared with higher status individuals. In addition, he found that lower status individuals used first-person plural (we) more relative to lower status individuals. This was tested using various [centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality) algorithms (degree, closeness, & betweenness) common in [Network Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory)  as a indicators of importance and status in a social network. This replication provided evidence both contrary and aligned with Pennebaker's findings. However, questions still remain as to how predictive centrality measures inferred from email communications are of social status within an hierarchy.
