In the Ontario general election of 2018 the Progressive Conservative Party, led by Doug Ford, won 76 of the 124 seats in the provincial parliament. The New Democratic Party, led by Andrea Horwath, gained the largest vote share and formed the Official Opposition with 40 seats. The Liberal Party, led by incumbent Premier Kathleen Wynne lost its official party status and recorded its worst result in the party's 161 year history. The Green Party won its first seat in the parties history.
  
Two key factors that proved to be decisive in this Election was the polarization of the vote and Doug Ford's popularity in Toronto Ridings:

Polls leading up to the election showed that most voters were undecided but wanted change. This split the electorate with many previous liberal voters moving to the NDP or Conservatives. Although the NDP won the popular vote their vote share gains came from the Liberals where the Conservatives were incumbents.

Doug Ford, who became party leader in a leadership race in 2018 due to the resignation of Patrick Brown, was very popular in many parts of Toronto. He was a former city councler and brother of the late Rob Ford who served as mayor from 2010 to 2014. The Fords were popular in pre-amalgamation suburbs of Toronto ridings in these areas were important battle ground ridings for the all major parties in the 2018 provincial election.

From these maps we can see that the election was a two horse race. In most ridings the winner and runner up were almost always the Conservatives and NDP. The Liberals were only competitive in 33 seats rather than 94 in 2018.

Most seats won from the Liberals went to the runners up of that seat in 2014. This lead to Conservatives gaining most of the Southern Ontario. The NDP made vote share gains and were runners up in 60 ridings.


## Ford Family Popularity in the City of Toronto

Doug Ford gained 41 seats many of them were won in the Toronto and the surrounding suburbs. These were important seat gains to form the majority. He won the largest share of seats in the GTA for the Conservatives since 1995.

The Liberals lost most of there seats in this Toronto and the GTA where they were previously dominant. The NDP made gains in the GTA aswell. However they failed to beat Ford and the Conservatives in pre-amalgamation suburbs.
